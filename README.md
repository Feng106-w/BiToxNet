## Welcome to BiToxNet: A Bilinear Attention-Based Framework for Neurotoxin Prediction of Peptides and Proteins
Neurotoxins derived from venomous organisms hold therapeutic potential but face identification challenges due to structural diversity. Existing computational methods are limited by shallow feature engineering, narrow generalizability, and inadequate multimodal fusion. To overcome these, we introduce BiToxNet, a deep learning framework that integrates evolutionary embeddings with ten handcrafted biochemical descriptors via a bilinear attention network (BAN). This design dynamically models residue-level interactions between evolutionary constraints and physicochemical properties. Evaluated on rigorously curated peptide, protein, and combined datasets, BiToxNet demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models. Additionally, ablation studies confirm the optimal design of our feature representation and the critical efficacy of BAN. Overall, the framework provides a scalable solution for accelerating neurotoxin discovery.
